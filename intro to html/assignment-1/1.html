    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>The <b>b HTML</b>element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents,
        which are not otherwise granted special importance.
        This was formerly known as the Boldface element,
        and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.</p>
    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>The <i>i HTML</i> element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.</p>
    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p>The  HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a <u>non-textual annotation</u>. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.</p>
    <h1>break tag</h1>
    <p>The br HTML element produces a line break <br/>in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</p>
    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>The hr HTML element represents a thematic break <hr/>between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.</p>
